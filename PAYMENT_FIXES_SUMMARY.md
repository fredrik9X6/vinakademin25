# Payment Issues Fixed ✅

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### ✅ **Issue 1: Form Nesting Error**
**Problem**: DiscountCodeInput had `<form>` inside main checkout `<form>`
```
In HTML, <form> cannot be a descendant of <form>.
```

**Fix**: 
- Changed DiscountCodeInput from `<form>` to `<div>`
- Updated button from `type="submit"` to `type="button"` with `onClick`
- Removed `e.preventDefault()` from handleSubmit

### ✅ **Issue 2: User Progress Course Field Error**
**Problem**: Course relationship field expected integer ID, but got string
```
Error [ValidationError]: The following field is invalid: Course
```

**Fix**:
- Added `parseInt(courseId, 10)` conversion in progress API
- Updated all course field references to use `courseIdInt`
- Added validation for invalid course IDs

### ✅ **Issue 3: CardElement Mounting Error**
**Problem**: CardElement unmounted when switching payment methods
```
We could not retrieve data from the specified Element.
Please make sure the Element you are attempting to use is still mounted.
```

**Fix**:
- Removed `paymentMethod` dependency from useEffect
- Always create initial payment intent with 'card' method
- Prevent CardElement recreation during payment method switches

### ✅ **Issue 4: Order Creation (Already Fixed)**
**Problem**: Order creation failed with relationship type errors
**Status**: ✅ **Working!** Console shows: `Payment API: Order created successfully: 20`

## 🚀 **Expected Working Flow Now**

1. **Environment**: ✅ Stripe keys loaded correctly
2. **Payment Intent**: ✅ Creates successfully  
3. **Order Creation**: ✅ Works without errors
4. **User Progress**: ✅ No more validation errors
5. **Form Validation**: ✅ No more HTML nesting errors
6. **CardElement**: ✅ Stays mounted during payment method switches

## 🎯 **Test Instructions**

**Restart your dev server** and test:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
npm run dev
```

### Test Steps:
1. Go to `/kurser/vinprovning-101`
2. Click purchase button
3. **Button should be enabled immediately** (blue, clickable)
4. Fill test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Try switching between Card/Klarna (button should stay functional)
6. Click "Betala 149,00 kr"
7. Should process successfully! 🎉

### Expected Console Output:
```
✅ Payment API: Order created successfully: [ID]
✅ No form nesting warnings
✅ No user progress errors
✅ CardElement stays mounted
```

## 🔍 **Debug Info Still Available**

The checkout form still shows debug information:
```
Debug: stripe=true, isProcessing=false, clientSecret=true, isInitialized=true
Button disabled: false
```

**All conditions should be `true` and button `disabled: false`**
