# Stripe Payment Flow Setup - FIXED âœ…

Your payment flow has been completely fixed and configured! Here's what was done and how to complete the setup:

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… 1. Dependencies Installed
- `@stripe/stripe-js` and `stripe` packages were already installed

### âœ… 2. Environment Variables Created
- Created `.env.local` with all required Stripe configuration
- Added subscription price IDs for monthly/annual plans

### âœ… 3. Stripe Products & Prices Created
- **Vinakademin Premium - MÃ¥nadsvis**: 299 SEK/month (`price_1RpvcPPTy61KUOOspxSqsDGe`)
- **Vinakademin Premium - Ã…rligen**: 2990 SEK/year (`price_1RpvcPPTy61KUOOspqTTPBR1`)  
- **Student - MÃ¥nadsvis**: 199 SEK/month (`price_1RpvcQPTy61KUOOsfWC5KqdD`)
- **Student - Ã…rligen**: 1990 SEK/year (`price_1RpvcRPTy61KUOOsNt4ydRJq`)

### âœ… 4. Course-Stripe Integration Fixed
- Existing "Vinprovning 101" course now properly linked to Stripe product
- Product ID: `prod_SkyXrToPEgGgmo`
- Price ID: `price_1RpSacPTy61KUOOsdV83aCKY` (149 SEK)

### âœ… 5. Payment Intent Creation Fixed  
- Re-enabled order creation in payment intent API
- Fixed user ID type issues
- Added proper error handling

### âœ… 6. Webhook Conflicts Resolved
- Removed duplicate webhook handler
- Single webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/stripe`

## Final Setup Steps

### 1. Add Your Real Stripe Keys

Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Get these from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

# Get this from https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks  
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_ACTUAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select these events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Copy the webhook secret to your `.env.local`

### 3. Update Course Stripe IDs (Optional)

If you want to link more courses to Stripe, run:
```bash
node scripts/update-course-stripe.js
```

### 4. Test the Payment Flow

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to a course page
3. Try purchasing the course
4. Payment should now work completely!

## Payment Flow Overview

### Frontend (Course Purchase)
1. User clicks "Buy Course" 
2. `CheckoutForm` component loads
3. Calls `/api/payments/create-payment-intent`
4. Stripe Elements handles payment collection
5. Payment confirmation redirects to success page

### Backend (Payment Processing)
1. **Payment Intent Creation** (`/api/payments/create-payment-intent`)
   - Validates user and course
   - Creates Stripe customer if needed
   - Creates payment intent with course metadata
   - Creates order record in database

2. **Webhook Processing** (`/api/webhooks/stripe`)
   - Handles `payment_intent.succeeded` events
   - Updates order status to "completed"
   - Creates enrollment record for user
   - Gives user access to course content

### Database Updates
- **Orders**: Tracks payment status and course purchases
- **Enrollments**: Grants course access after successful payment
- **Courses**: Linked to Stripe products and prices

## Subscription Payments

The subscription plans are ready to use:

```typescript
// Monthly subscription
const monthlyPrice = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID

// Annual subscription  
const annualPrice = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID

// Student plans
const studentMonthly = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STUDENT_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID
const studentAnnual = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STUDENT_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID
```

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Intent Creation Fails
- Check that Stripe keys are set correctly
- Verify course has `stripePriceId` set
- Check server logs for detailed errors

### Webhook Events Not Processing  
- Verify webhook endpoint is accessible
- Check webhook secret matches `.env.local`
- Test webhook in Stripe dashboard

### Order Creation Fails
- Check database connection
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check order schema requirements

## Security Notes

- Never expose secret keys in frontend code
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
